As Client is deleted from website the Trigger will run on Delete and delete all reference from three table. After that create one more trigger as below.

Table Agenda

Time After

Event Delete

BEGIN
  DELETE FROM agenda_presentation where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agenda_presentation_pc where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agenda_speaker where agendaID = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agenda_audience where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agendawebvideo where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agendanotes where session_id = OLD.id;

Code:

CREATE TRIGGER `delet_agenda` AFTER DELETE ON `agenda`
 FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
  DELETE FROM agenda_presentation where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agenda_presentation_pc where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agenda_speaker where agendaID = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agenda_audience where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agendawebvideo where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agendanotes where session_id = OLD.id;
  DELETE FROM agendafiles where session_id = OLD.id;
END
  DELETE FROM agendafiles where session_id = OLD.id;
END

As such agenda will be deleted all the entries from above tables will also be deleted as the second trigger will hit automatically.
